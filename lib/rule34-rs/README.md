# rule34-rs
A library to interact with https://rule34.xxx. 
The api for rule34 appears to be based of an old version of gelbooru's.
It contains many bugs and hidden, obsoleted api options that only work on this website.
This library binds over these hidden options in an attempt to make it more useful, at the cost of being not generalizable to other Boorus.

## Features
`cli`: Off by default. Used for building the CLI.
