Yet another generic discord bot.

***Are your friends too mentally stable? We can fix that!***

### Getting Started
1. Download [Rust](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Download this repository.
3. Create your own `.env` file in the repo. See the [env template file](./.env.template) for info. You should be fine just renaming that file.
3. Run `cargo build --release` in the repo.
4. Find `pikadick.exe` under `target/release`.
5. Move it anywhere and place your `config.toml` in the same directory. See the file [config template file](./config.toml.template) to see how to make a config file.
6. Open a command line in the same dir as the exe and run `./pikadick.exe` (or just double-click it). 
7. ???
8. Profit?

NOTE: Make your own release profile if you want fancy things like LTO.
